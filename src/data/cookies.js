Portion 1/4 of the filling down the center of each strip. Lift one long side of the dough up and over the filling, and repeat with the opposite side to enclose the filling (fold dough as if folding a business-size letter). Pinch the 2 sides together at the edges. Carefully transfer the roll to the prepared baking sheet, placing them seam side down. Repeat with second strip of dough, then repeat entire process with second rectangle.\r\n\r\nBake until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven, cool for 2 minutes, then slice each strip into 1-inch pieces, cutting diagonally. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.\r\n\r\nTo prepare mocha ganache: Place chocolate chips in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a boil and stir in powdered espresso. Pour cream mixture over 3/4 cup chocolate chips and stir until smooth, adding more chips, if necessary, to reach desired consistency Allow ganache to cool until it has thickened but remains liquid. Using a spoon, pour ganache over cookies, allowing ganache to drip down sides. Place on a wire rack for ganache to set.","notes":"This dough must be prepared in advance.
