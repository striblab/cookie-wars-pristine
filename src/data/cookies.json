Then you can assemble everything, put it back in the refrigerator, and come back later and bake it.”</p>","thumbnail":"https://static.startribune.com/news/projects/all/20191106-cookie-wars/media/recipes/resized/chocolate-fig-rolls.jpg"},{"id":2,"name":"White Chocolate and Cherry Tea Cakes","summary":"A decadent and elegant interpretation of the classic Mexican Wedding Cake cookie.","baker":[{"name":"Teri Laster","hometown":"Bloomington"}],"features":["Chocolate","Fruit","Nut"],"cookie_type":"Drop","year":2018,"recipe_yield":"Makes about 3 dozen cookies.","ingredients_clean":"<ul>\n<li>1 c.

I thought an espresso bean would be a cute garnish.” Even better, how about a chocolate-covered espresso bean?</p>\n<p><strong>Prior finalist:</strong> Holtmeier made it to the top five in 2017 with her Limoncello Kisses. “Later, lots of people told me, ‘Oh, I made your cookie,’ and I would say to them, ‘I hope you liked it, but I don’t want to be responsible if you didn’t,’ ” she said with a laugh. “But how could you not like it?”</p>\n<p><strong>Early start:</strong> “I was in high school when I began baking cookies, in part because it was a good way of expressing love and kindness,” said Holtmeier. “I still like to give away things — bars, and pies and cakes — because it’s a great excuse to connect with people.”</p>\n<p>Judges’ comments: If you like Bailey’s Irish Cream, then these are the cookies for you,” said one. “Great chewy texture,” added another.

The nearest supermarket was 20 miles away, but the store sent out the grocery equivalent of a Bookmobile to serve its far-flung customers, and a version of this cookie was the goodie her host family always had on its shopping list.

This particular version is the one that I had when I was there, so this is the version that I like.\" Jones prefers dipping the cookie in bittersweet chocolate. \"But I've also used semisweet, and some people might like regular milk chocolate,\" she said. \"It's all to your own taste.\"</p>\n<p>Judges’ comments: \"Chocolate and almond, an ideal cookie combination,\" sighed one judge. \"I love the play on textures,\" raved another. \"Sophisticated,\" decreed a third.</p>\n<p>Baker’s tip: Jones recommends using a box grater to quickly and evenly shred the almond paste. Also, make sure the melted chocolate has cooled enough so that it won't melt the chilled buttercream filling when dipping the cookies. \"It's lots of cooling and waiting, and cooling and waiting, so you need a little patience,\" she said. \"They're a little bit putzy that way, but they're worth it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>A first:</strong> \"I've always really liked to bake, but I've never entered a contest before,\" said Jones. \"I see this contest every year and I think, 'Oh, I wonder if they've ever had a cookie like this?'

You don’t end up with bits of tea leaves in the dough.”</p>\n<p>Beyond Lipton’s: White prefers the distinctively smoky flavor and aroma of Lapsang Souchong tea. “It’s like getting punched in the face by a campfire,” she said. “I’ll go a few weeks without it, and then I’ll get a craving for it.”</p>\n<p>Why shortbread? “It’s an ease-of-baking thing,” she said. “Then I googled ‘cheese cookies,’ and found a basic recipe from the Wisconsin Cheese Board.

I don’t really think that they’re shortbread any ►   ◄ more.”</p>\n<p><strong>Savory on savory:</strong> “I like cheese,” she said. “I don’t know any adults who don’t. Most savory shortbreads usually head toward Cheddar. But I thought that blue cheese could hold up to the Lapsang Souchong. The dried cherries were a last-minute addition, because I had some in the kitchen at the time. Next time, I might try Craisins. I knew that I was on to something when my family snapped them up.”</p>\n<p>Baker’s tip: Patience. “The recipe takes longer than you might expect,” she said. “You have to make the tea-infused butter, and that takes time to heat, steep and cool. And be sure to take the time to actually chill the dough in the refrigerator.”</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite baking tool:</strong> “My KitchenAid stand mixer, definitely,” she said. “When I was in graduate school and didn’t have it, I didn’t bake as much. I did manage to borrow one for a research project on meringues. I couldn’t have done it without one. My other favorite is a pastry blender. I like it better than using two forks. You can really put the full force of your arms and hands into it. That makes it so much easier.”</p>\n<p><strong>Happy times:</strong> “My earliest memories are of my mom, baking in the kitchen,” she said. “I really enjoy baking. We do a bunch of Christmas cookies.

It’s a good drink, and it got me thinking that it might be a good cookie.”</p>\n<p><strong>Family connection:</strong> The basic cookie recipe started with a formula from a timeworn church cookbook. “It’s the church where my dad grew up,” she said. “There are at least four kinds of ginger cookies in that cookbook, and I decided to go with one from my dad’s cousin. I like ginger, but I don’t like molasses. I began with that basic recipe, and I started taking things out, and putting things in, and adding a little more whiskey every time.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nuts about cashews:</strong> “That part of the recipe is original,” she said. “I discovered these maple- and ginger-glazed cashews at Lakewinds Food Co-op in Richfield, and I thought, ‘I have to figure how to glaze cashews.’ It’s easy, and they’re really good to eat just by themselves.”</p>\n<p>Baker’s tip: Don’t have any whiskey in the house? “Just buy that little bottle,” she said. “It’s all you need for the recipe.” She’s referring to the inexpensive, 50-milliliter size that’s often sold at the liquor store checkout stand.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite baking tool:</strong> “I can’t imagine baking without parchment paper,” she said. “And for cookies, I like to use an ice cream scoop, but there’s a drawback. I now have something that I refer to as ‘Cookie Elbow.’ My oldest son got married at the end of September, and my mom and I baked 21 dozen cookies for the rehearsal dinner. Using a scoop for that long, with that much repetition, gave me tennis elbow.”</p>\n<p><strong>Why she enters:</strong> This is Heirigs’ third appearance in our contest. She was a 2014 finalist for Tart and Sassy Cranberry Lemon Drops and a 2010 finalist for Hot and Sassy Peanut Butter Buds. “I love the Mill City Museum event,” she said. “I go most years, even when I don’t make the finals.

My parents are both good bakers, and so I grew up in one of those houses where everything was homemade, all the time. Some people come home from work and boil water for dinner. I take out eggs and butter.\"</p>\n<p>A treasured family treat, updated: Rohr started with his tattered recipe card for a cream of tartar-based sugar cookie, which is a copy of a similarly well-worn card from his grandmother's kitchen. \"I don't know where she got them — my dad can't remember, either — but I've been making them for a million years,\" he said. The filling, however, was all his idea. \"I just started messing around,\" he said. \"It's really hard for me to follow a recipe. I'm a fairly intuitive cook and baker.\" The colorful finishing touch —rolling the edge in finely chopped pistachios — came after a few tasting sessions with friends. \"It needed some crunch,\" he said.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter to win:</strong> \"My friend Eric texted me in early October and said, 'You should win the Star Tribune cookie contest this year.'

They held their shape well, and it saved a ton of time.\" Speaking of timesavers, we preferred to grind all the pistachios in the food processor at once; when it comes to the nuts used to decorate the cookie's rolled edge, detail-oriented Rohr chops them by hand. \"I don't like the dust that the food processor creates,\" he said. \"It's not as pretty.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Keep them small:</strong> \"They look better that way,\" he said. \"What I like about them is that they're not overwhelmingly sweet, but if they get too big, the frosting gets to be too much.\"</p>\n<p><strong>An added bonus:</strong> \"They're not complicated, and they come together fast,\" he said. \"They look like something substantial, but they're not hard to make.

My mother was head chef at Oliver Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, and people were always asking for these cookies, they were such a hit.

The couple would frequently jump on a train and visit her family in Cesena, a small city in Emilia-Romagna, happily immersing themselves in the cooking lives of his girlfriend's parents and grandparents. \"They were so lovely,\" Teresa said. \"I learned to make pasta with them. We'd spend hours making dough, and laughing. It was wonderful to be in a place where food is so rooted in tradition and place, and to encounter something that has always been made by the same people, with little variation.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The takeway:</strong> One of the grandmothers baked a chewy-crispy and outrageously rich almond cookie, which the family enjoyed with espresso. Teresa was instantly smitten. Unfortunately, the cookie's recipe didn't return to the United States with him. \"She was wary of sharing a family recipe,\" he said. \"That's their pride.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Diligence:</strong> After doing his research, Teresa stumbled upon a similar-sounding sweet. \"Ricciarelli,\" he said. \"They're from Siena, in Tuscany, and not that far from Bologna.\" He began to tweak the formula (less sugar, for starters), and as each iteration inched closer to the unassuming-looking cookie of his memory, he became confident that he'd hit replication pay dirt. \"Since then, I've probably made them a hundred times,\" he said. \"They're not like any other American cookie. Maybe that's why so many people ask me for the recipe.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dietary surprise:</strong> Among its many appealing virtues — it's a very easy recipe to pull together, for example — this is a gluten-free cookie.</p>\n<p><strong>Have faith:</strong> \"I never think that one egg white is going to make the dough wet enough to hold together,\" Teresa said. \"But it does.

Otherwise, they'll turn into rocks an hour later.\"</p>\n<p>That's Italian: Teresa's time abroad confirmed a quietly harbored suspicion. \"I'm a quarter Italian; the rest is a mishmash,\" he said with a laugh. \"But that's the part that I definitely connect with.

She shared. It was a communal experience.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Making it her own:</strong> When a cinnamon bun cookie craze rolled across the nation's baking consciousness a few years ago, Hurd was all for it. \"Everyone can relate to a cinnamon roll,\" she said. \"I know I can.\" The problem was that she never found a recipe that worked. \"So I kind of developed my own,\" Hurd said. Turns out, creating recipes is second nature to Hurd. A well-known presence on the recipe contest circuit, she has three Pillsbury Bake-Offs under her apron, and has won fame, fortune ($25,000 for a cranberry scone recipe) and trips to New York, Chicago, Orlando, Napa Valley and other destinations. \"It's a fun hobby,\" she said.</p>\n<p><strong>Immediate impact:</strong> Hurd and her family have a strict regimen of tried-and-true holiday cookie favorites, and the roster seldom if ever varies from December to December. \"We're very picky about them, and everyone has their favorite,\" she said.

Cinnamon Bun Cookies did. \"It's a hard thing to crack into our holiday cookie tray, but this one now has a permanent place on it,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Baker’s tip: \"To me, there is nothing like the smell of cinnamon,\" Hurd said. Because cinnamon is the recipe's centerpiece ingredient, she splurges on Vietnamese Extra Fancy ground cinnamon, found at Penzeys (three Twin Cities area locations). \"I think it really makes a difference,\" she said. \"It's the fragrance, it's the color, it's the taste, it's everything.\" Hurd also lessens holiday baking stress by preparing cookie doughs in advance and freezing them. \"This is one of those doughs,\" she said. \"You roll it, you stick it in the freezer, and it's so easy to bake.\"</p>","thumbnail":"https://static.startribune.com/news/projects/all/20191106-cookie-wars/media/recipes/resized/ows_138616180723459.jpg"},{"id":78,"name":"Chocolate Peppermint Cookies","summary":"A new holiday favorite for kids of all ages.","baker":[{"name":"Karen Evans","hometown":"Minneapolis"}],"features":["Easy","Chocolate","Fun with kids"],"cookie_type":"Drop","year":2014,"recipe_yield":"Makes about 2 dozen cookies.","ingredients_clean":"<div><strong>For cookies:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>1 1/2 c. flour</li>\n<li>1/2 c. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>\n<li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>\n<li>1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>\n<li>1/4 tsp. baking soda</li>\n<li>1/2 c.

It’s fun to look into the archive, and compare my cookie to the new cookies.” Several years after her prizewinning entry, she was toiling away in her cubicle at work. “And one of my co-workers walked up with a new employee and said, ‘Laurinda, this is Michelle. She’s the person who made your cookie,’” said Clark. “She was so excited to meet me, and she started jokingly calling herself ‘My Cookie Stalker.’ I launched a nice friendship over that cookie.”</p>\n<p><strong>Why she entered:</strong> “Because I had so much fun the first time, to be honest,” said Clark. “My friend Seamus [Kirwin] saw how fun and exciting it was, and he wanted to get in on that. We started thinking about a cookie almost two years ago. We started test-baking in August, and there were some serious failures. We got together about once a week for six weeks, to get the balance right.”</p>\n<p>Yes, a snickerdoodle: “It’s because it’s Seamus’ all-time favorite cookie,” said Clark. “Plus, it’s easy to make, it’s accessible.” The plum idea also came from Kirwin. “He had this vision to invoke the Sugar Plum Fairy from ‘The Nutcracker,’ ” said Clark. “But he has zero baking background. I’m the one with the history and the love of baking. That’s why we worked as a team on this.”</p>\n<p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> “Yes, we’re already thinking about another flavor combination for another year,” said Clark. “This is too much fun not to do.”</p>\n<p>Judges’ comments: “I thought you couldn’t improve the snickerdoodle, but this proves that you can,” said one. “Those mulling spices really transform the jam,” added another.

Freiband loved it, and it got her thinking.</p>\n<p>A locavore’s cookie: Eighteen years ago, when Freiband moved into her south Minneapolis house, she planted a pair of what turned about to be highly productive Haralson apple trees. “This year, I had 30 people at the house, picking apples,” she said. “It’s the neighborhood tree.” She channels her backyard bounty into crisps, pies and galettes. Oh, and apple butter, which became her recipe’s key ingredient.</p>\n<p><strong>Festive shape:</strong> Freiband reached for her star-shaped cookie cutter for a reason. “There’s something about Christmas and stars,” she said. “I’ve always related Christmas to something brilliant in the sky, rather than the traditional trees, or wreaths. I always decorate the front of my house with stars.”</p>\n<p><strong>Take the time:</strong> Are the cutouts worth the effort? Absolutely. “Food is not wonderful until it looks beautiful,” said Freiband. “Never serve anything until it looks gorgeous. That’s the photographer in me.”</p>\n<p><strong>Play around:</strong> “You can totally improvise on the filling,” Freiband said. “Have fun. Experiment. My mom was a super baker, and she never used recipes. I have an Italian plum tree, so this year I made a lemon-ginger plum jam. That would be fabulous in this cookie.”</p>\n<p>Judges’ comments: “So pretty,” said one. “They just say, ‘holiday,’” said another. “The texture resembles a pie crust that’s made with pecans,” said yet another.

They turn out more than a dozen different sweets, including maple yule logs, thumbprints and, of course, Cappuccino Flats. By nightfall, husbands and now grandchildren join the group for cookie decorating and pizza eating, and everyone leaves with cookie-filled containers.</p>\n<p><strong>Family favorite:</strong> Sivald discovered Cappuccino Flats in a Better Homes and Gardens cookbook \"so long ago that I can't remember the exact date,\" she said. It wouldn't be Christmas at the Sivald home without these elegant, richly flavored cookies. </p>\n<p>Judges’ comments: \"They would be equally good with a cup of coffee or a glass of champagne,\" noted one of our judges. \"So elegant,\" said another. \"They would really stand out on a cookie tray,\" added a third. \"You just can't beat that combination of coffee and chocolate, and they're not too sweet,\" was a fourth's endorsement.</p>\n<p>Gluten-free: After her daughters switched to gluten-free diets, Sivald began experimenting with different formulas. Giving up baking altogether was not an option. \"I would have felt so deprived,\" she said. \"My motto was, 'So many pastries, so little time.' \" After some instructive trial and error, she now swears by <a href=\"http://www.authenticfoods.com/products/item/43/GF-Classical-Blend\" target=\"_blank\">Authentic Foods brand gluten-free flour</a>. Over the years, she and her daughters have converted all of their recipes to gluten-free formulas, \"and people can't tell the difference,\" Sivald said. For Cappuccino Flats, Sivald substitutes with a ratio of 3/4 cup gluten-free flour for 1 cup all-purpose flour. \"The results are fabulous,\" she said. Other gluten-free baking lessons learned: Use butter, not shortening, and if the recipe calls for milk, use cream. \"With gluten-free, more fat is better,\" she said.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendly nudge:</strong> Patrice Johnson, our 2012 contest winner — and 2013 finalist — played a role in Sivald's win this year. The two women are colleagues. \"And when we were sharing baking stories, she told me that I had to enter this cookie,\" Sivald said. \"And so I did.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Best for last:</strong> One of the recipe's most endearing attributes is how easy it is to prepare, a simple cut-and-bake refrigerator method. \"They're so good that I sometimes wonder why I only make them at Christmas,\" said Sivald. \"But maybe that's what makes them so special.

It's good to know that playing in the kitchen pays off once in a while.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Extra topping:</strong> That crystallized ginger-orange garnish is there for more than just flavor. \"I think things taste better if they look better,\" she said. \"I bake a lot of muffins, and I always like to top them with something, so when you look at them you know what you're biting into.\"</p>\n<p>Baker’s tip: Francke relies on her senses, rather than a timer, when baking. \"I always eyeball it, checking periodically, and I touch it,\" she said. \"With these cookies, you don't want to leave a deep impression, it has to have some spring to it. Take them out of the oven when they're just starting to firm up.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Stress relief:</strong> \"After a full day of work, you'll find me in the kitchen,” she said. “It's one of my passions. At home, although it's down to just my husband and myself, I find that I'm still buying flour every other day. I like to share with friends, and keep the freezer stocked. At work they've designated me as the baker for birthdays. I enjoy that.\"</p>","thumbnail":"https://static.startribune.com/news/projects/all/20191106-cookie-wars/media/recipes/resized/cookieThumb-180895251.jpg"},{"id":21,"name":"Chocolate-Drizzled Churros","summary":"A festive, spritz-inspired version of the Mexican treat.","baker":[{"name":"Lance Swanson","hometown":"North Branch"}],"features":["Chocolate","International"],"cookie_type":"Drop","year":2011,"recipe_yield":"Makes 5 to 6 dozen cookies.","ingredients_clean":"<ul>\n<li>½ cup plus 2/3 cup sugar, divided</li>\n<li>2½ teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>\n<li>2½ cups flour</li>\n<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>\n<li>3 egg yolks, at room temperature</li>\n<li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>\n<li>3.15 ounces Mexican chocolate, chopped (see Taste Tip)</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon heavy cream or half-and-half</li>\n</ul>","procedure_clean":"<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>\n<p>In a small bowl, combine ½ cup sugar and 1½ teaspoons cinnamon, and reserve.
